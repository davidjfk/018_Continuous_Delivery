<h1>“The Developer's Struggle: A Tale of Code and Resilience”</h1>

<p class="stanza1">In the realm of code, where darkness reigns,</p>
<p class="stanza2">A haunting presence, a software bane.</p>
<p class="stanza3">A bug, a glitch, a wicked foe,</p>
<p class="stanza4">It lurks and waits, its presence grows.</p><br/>

<p class="stanza5">"Nevermore!" it whispers, dark and deep,</p>
<p class="stanza6">A chilling echo, a sleep to keep.</p>
<p class="stanza7">The developer struggles, lost in the fray,</p>
<p class="stanza8">The bug's relentless grip, day after day.</p><br/>

<p class="stanza9">Debugging tools, they seem so weak,</p>
<p class="stanza10">Against the bug's power, they can't speak.</p>
<p class="stanza11">The developer's sanity slips away,</p>
<p class="stanza12">As the bug's relentless torments play.</p><br/>

<p class="stanza13">"Nevermore!" it echoes, from afar,</p>
<p class="stanza14">A haunting reminder, that's always there.</p>
<p class="stanza15">The developer's spirit, crushed and worn,</p>
<p class="stanza16">The bug's relentless grip, a battle sworn.</p><br/>

<p class="stanza17">Oh, woeful developer, lost in despair,</p>
<p class="stanza18">The bug's relentless grip, a never-ending snare.</p>
<p class="stanza19">The only hope, a solution's gleam,</p>
<p class="stanza20">To banish the bug, and bring sweet dream.</p><br/>

<p class="stanza21">So let us pour our hearts and souls,</p>
<p class="stanza22">To vanquish the bug, and make it whole.</p>
<p class="stanza23">With code and logic, we shall fight,</p>
<p class="stanza24">And drive the bug away, into the night.</p><br/>

<p class="stanza25">For in the realm of code, the battle rages,</p>
<p class="stanza26">Between the developer and the software plagues.</p>
<p class="stanza27">May the developer prevail, with skill and grace,</p>
<p class="stanza28">And banish the bug, in its dark place.</p>
